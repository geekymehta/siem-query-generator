# Sigma Query Generator
  A demo instance of this project is running at https://siem-query-generator.netlify.app/
  
  **Please note that the website might take some time to load as it's flask-backend is hosted on a free instance of Render, which enters sleep mode after 30 minutes of inactivity.**

# Getting Started
  React-client:
  ```
  cd sigma_query_generator_client
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

flask-server:
  ```
  cd sigma_query_generator_server
  pip install -r reqirements.txt
  python run.py
  ```

You should be able to reach the application now at:
